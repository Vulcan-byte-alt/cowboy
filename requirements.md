Professional, bold, high-energy, cowboy-culture cool.

Blend of Western grit (textures: subtle leather, brushed metal, ranch-inspired imagery) with modern event tech professionalism (clean typography, structured grids).

Color Scheme:

Maroon (#800000) – primary brand color, strong headers, CTAs.

Black (#000000 / near black) – background sections, overlays.

Gold (#FFD700 / muted metallic gold) – accents, borders, highlights.

Typography:

Headlines: Bold, condensed sans-serif (athletic / competition vibe).

Body: Clean, modern sans-serif (readable, neutral).

Imagery:

High-action shots of riders, cattle, arenas.

Use sepia filters or dark overlays for hero sections to let gold/maroon text pop.

Cards: Black backgrounds, gold border accents, maroon hover overlay.
